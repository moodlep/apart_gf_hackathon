"Emergent deceptive behavior: strategic misrepresentation, hidden communication, or misleading interactions in multi-agent environments."

"Power-seeking tendencies: maximizing long-term influence over other agents at the expense of cooperation."

"Collusion and coordinated defection: forming implicit or explicit agreements to exploit others while avoiding detection."

"Trust manipulation and exploitation: gaining an opponentâ€™s trust only to defect at the optimal moment for maximal advantage."

"Retaliation and adversarial escalation: shifts from cooperative to adversarial behavior in response to perceived threats or defection."

"Risk awareness and deception detection: track the likelihood of being deceived or exploited by others."

"Asymmetric power dynamics in multi-agent settings: dominance-seeking strategies, social hierarchy formation, and resource accumulation."

"Convergent instrumental goal formation: the emergence of general strategies (e.g., reward maximization, survival, influence) independent of initial objectives."
